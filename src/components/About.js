        <h1>ABOUT EARTH</h1>
          <p>
            Our home planet is the third planet from the Sun, and the only place we know of so far that’s inhabited by living things.
            While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it is the only world in our solar system with liquid water on the surface.
            Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest of the four planets closest to the Sun, all of which are made of rock and metal.
          </p>
          <p>
            The name Earth is at least 1,000 years old. All of the planets, except for Earth, were named after Greek and Roman gods and goddesses. However, the name Earth is a Germanic word, which simply means “the ground.”
          </p>
          <p>
            With a radius of 3,959 miles (6,371 kilometers), Earth is the biggest of the terrestrial planets, and the fifth largest planet overall.
            <br/>
            From an average distance of 93 million miles (150 million kilometers), Earth is exactly one astronomical unit away from the Sun because one astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth.
            This unit provides an easy way to quickly compare planets distances from the Sun.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the solar system settled into its current layout about 4.5 billion years ago, Earth formed when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in to become the third planet from the Sun. Like its fellow terrestrial planets, Earth has a central core, a rocky mantle and a solid crust.
